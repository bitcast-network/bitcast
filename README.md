# Bitcast - The Decentralized Creator Economy

Welcome to **Bitcast** - where content creators are incentivised to connect brands to audiences. Creators publish content to meet a brief and are evaluated on their engagement statistics.

Our initial focus will be on educational and promotional youtube content for concepts, platforms and subnets within the bittensor ecosystem in order to ease what we believe is bittensor's biggest barrier to entry - it's complexity. We will then be ready to direct our miner network towards numerous other areas and markets.

## High-Level Architecture

- **Miners**: Create and publish YouTube content to meet one or more of the content briefs.
- **Validators**: Request a temporary OAuth token from the miner and securely connect to the miner's YouTube backend analytics to evaluate video engagement.
- **Brands**: Set the briefs - In phase 1 the briefs will be set by the Bitcast team and will focus on the Bittensor ecosystem.
- **Briefs Server**: Serves the [list of briefs](https://www.dashboard.bitcast.network/briefs)
- **Bittensor Network**: The decentralized blockchain in which the compensation is managed and paid out by the validators to the miners through the Bitcast alpha token.

## Getting Started

### For Miners

Miners can connect their YouTube accounts to the network and begin publishing relevant content.

In order to ensure high quality content, minimum requirements must be met by the miner's YouTube account and videos.

Videos that meet the [minimum requirements](bitcast/miner/README.md) will be compared against the briefs. Videos which meet the brief will be evaluated for reward.

Rewards will be split evenly between briefs. Miner's compete for a share of the rewards within each brief based on **total minutes watched**.

If you are a content creator and would like to contribute to the network, please refer to the [Miner Setup Guide](bitcast/miner/README.md) for instructions on how to:

- Install the miner software.
- Connect your YouTube account.
- Register your miner and connect to the network.
- Get rewarded for your content!

### For Validators

Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the Bitcast Network. Validators ensure that miners are fairly compensated based on the performance of their content and prevent fraudulent activities.

For more details, visit the [Validator Setup Guide](bitcast/validator/README.md).
