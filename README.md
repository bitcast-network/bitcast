# Bitcast ‚Äî The Decentralized Creator Economy

Bitcast is a decentralized platform that incentivizes content creators to connect brands with audiences. Creators publish YouTube videos to satisfy defined briefs and earn rewards based on engagement metrics.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

- **Miners**: Produce and publish YouTube content for one or more briefs.  
- **Validators**: Obtain temporary OAuth tokens to securely access YouTube Analytics and validate performance.  
- **Brands**: Define and publish content briefs (initially focused on the Bittensor ecosystem).  
- **Briefs Server**: Hosts the [active briefs](https://www.dashboard.bitcast.network/briefs).  
- **Bittensor Network**: Manages on-chain compensation, disbursing Bitcast alpha tokens from Validators to Miners.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Miners

1. **Review Requirements**  
   Ensure your YouTube account and videos meet the [minimum requirements](bitcast/miner/README.md).

2. **Publish Content**  
   Create videos targeting one or more active briefs.

3. **Earn Rewards**  
   Videos that satisfy briefs are ranked by **total minutes watched**, and rewards are distributed evenly across briefs.

See the [Miner Setup Guide](bitcast/miner/README.md) for:
- Installation and configuration  
- OAuth and account integration  
- Miner registration on the network  
- Reward tracking and monitoring

### For Validators

Validators maintain the integrity of the network by:
- Retrieving analytics data via OAuth  
- Verifying content engagement  
- Disbursing on-chain rewards to Miners

Refer to the [Validator Setup Guide](bitcast/validator/README.md) for detailed instructions.
